## 5. Discussion:

In this experiment, the focus was on creating well-structured documentation using Markdown language. The document demonstrated various Markdown features such as headers, emphasis, tables, images, links, and code blocks.

1. **Headers**: Different levels of headers were used, ranging from `Header 1` & `Header 6`, to organize the content in a hierarchical manner. This is important for readability and structuring documents logically.

2. **Emphasis**: Markdown offers multiple ways to emphasize text. Italics were applied using both underscores (`_`) and stars (`*`), while bold text was demonstrated using double underscores (`__`) and double stars (`**`). Additionally, bold and italic combinations were shown to highlight key points within the text.

3. **Strike-through**: The example also illustrated how to apply strike-through to text using `~~`. This can be helpful in situations where one wants to indicate outdated or irrelevant information without removing it.

4. **Links**: Links to external websites were embedded, showing how Markdown simplifies adding hyperlinks without complex HTML tags. This enhances navigation, making the document interactive and resourceful.

5. **Tables**: The inclusion of a table demonstrated how Markdown can organize data effectively in a tabular format. This is especially useful for presenting structured information like comparisons, datasets, or lists.

6. **Images**: Adding images within Markdown was shown by embedding a link to a remote image. This capability allows for visual content to be integrated seamlessly into documents, enriching the user experience.

Overall, this experiment demonstrated the versatility and simplicity of Markdown for creating professional and structured documents. It is particularly useful in environments like GitHub, technical blogs, or collaborative documentation, where quick formatting and readability are key. Markdown’s lightweight syntax allows for swift adoption while maintaining clarity across different types of content.

**2**

## 2. Experiment Name:  
Best Coding Practices

## 3. Objectives:  
- To understand and implement best practices in coding.
- To write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- To learn techniques that improve readability, reduce errors, and enhance collaboration.

## 4. Source Code and Description:  

### **Source Code** (Example in C):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;
    
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num1);

    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num2);

    sum = calculateSum(num1, num2);

    printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Description**:  
In this code, we demonstrate several best coding practices:
1. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Variables `num1`, `num2`, and `sum` have meaningful names, making it easy to understand what they represent.
2. **Functions for Code Reusability**: The `calculateSum` function is created to encapsulate the logic of adding two numbers. This improves modularity and allows for reuse.
3. **Comments**: Proper comments are provided to describe each section of the code, helping others (or your future self) understand the logic quickly.
4. **Input Validation**: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers, and this input is then processed.
5. **Efficient Code**: The sum calculation is done in a function, keeping the `main` function clean and focused on high-level flow.
6. **Formatting**: The code is formatted with consistent indentation, making it readable and maintainable.

## 5. Discussion:  

In this experiment, the focus was on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code, which is a key aspect of **best coding practices**. Several practices were demonstrated through the provided C code:

1. **Readable Code**: One of the primary goals of good coding practices is to write code that is easy to read and understand. Using meaningful variable and function names, along with proper indentation, greatly improves code readability.

2. **Modularity**: By encapsulating the sum calculation in a separate function, the code becomes more modular and easier to test or modify. This approach promotes **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principles, where repetitive code is avoided.

3. **Comments and Documentation**: Comments provide context to the reader about the purpose of different sections of code. This is especially helpful when revisiting the code later or when sharing it with collaborators.

4. **Efficiency**: Writing functions to handle specific tasks improves efficiency, as they can be reused across the program without needing to rewrite the logic.

5. **Maintainability**: Following best practices makes the code easier to maintain. For instance, if the logic for summing numbers needs to change, modifying the `calculateSum` function will suffice, without needing to alter the `main` function.

By adhering to these best practices, the code becomes less prone to errors, easier to debug, and more scalable in the long term. This approach also fosters better collaboration when multiple developers are involved in the project.

## 1. Experiment No:
**3**

## 2. Experiment Name:
Exploring Essential Git Commands

## 3. Objectives:
- To gain an understanding of commonly used Git commands.
- To learn how to utilize Git for managing code and collaborating effectively.
- To practice using Git to handle repositories and track changes in projects.

## 4. Theory:
Git is a widely-used distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in code, work on separate branches, and merge updates. It enables collaboration by allowing multiple people to work on the same project without conflict. This experiment covers essential Git commands used for creating, managing, and updating repositories, and for handling version control efficiently.

### Common Git Commands:
1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git clone`: Copies an existing repository to a local machine.
3. `git status`: Shows the current state of the repository and any uncommitted changes.
4. `git add`: Moves changes to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.
5. `git commit`: Saves the staged changes as a snapshot in the repository.
6. `git log`: Displays the history of commits in the repository.
7. `git push`: Uploads changes from a local repository to a remote one.
8. `git pull`: Fetches and integrates updates from a remote repository into the local one.
9. `git branch`: Manages branches in a repository, creating or deleting them.
10. `git merge`: Merges changes from one branch into another.

## 5. Procedure:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   - Run `git init` to set up a new Git repository in your current directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Clone an existing repository**:
   - Use `git clone` to copy an existing repository from a remote server to your local machine.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Check the repository status**:
   - Run `git status` to check the current status of the repository, including any unstaged changes.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

4. **Add changes to the staging area**:
   - Use `git add` to stage changes, making them ready for the next commit.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add filename.txt
     git add .
     ```

5. **Commit the changes**:
   - Run `git commit` to save the staged changes with a descriptive commit message.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

6. **View the commit history**:
   - Use `git log` to display the history of commits made in the repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Push changes to a remote repository**:
   - Use `git push` to send local commits to a remote repository, like GitHub.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Pull updates from a remote repository**:
   - Run `git pull` to fetch updates from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

9. **Create and switch branches**:
   - Use `git branch` to create a new branch and switch to it.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch feature-branch
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```

10. **Merge branches**:
    - Run `git merge` to merge changes from one branch into another.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge feature-branch
      ```

## 6. Source Code and Output:

### Commands:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check repository status
git status

# Stage changes for commit
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull updates from a remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Merge changes from a branch
git merge feature-branch
```

### Output:
Running these commands will allow you to set up and manage a Git repository, track changes, and collaborate with other developers efficiently.

## 7. Discussion:
This experiment provided practical exposure to Git commands crucial for version control in software development. 

1. **Repository Setup**: Using `git init` to start a new repository and `git clone` to copy an existing one gives developers a way to manage and work on different projects locally and remotely.

2. **Tracking and Staging Changes**: The `git status` command is essential for checking the current state of files, while `git add` stages changes, preparing them to be saved in the repository.

3. **Committing and Pushing**: `git commit` captures the current state of the project, with a message describing what was changed. `git push` allows you to share your work with others by uploading it to a remote repository.

4. **Branching and Merging**: Creating and switching between branches with `git branch` enables developers to work on features or fixes independently. `git merge` allows us to combine different development paths.
